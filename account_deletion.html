  <h1>Account & Data Deletion</h1>

  <section>
    <p>
      EasyInfoView allows users to delete their account and all related data directly within the app.
      Deleting your account is permanent and cannot be undone.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>How to request account deletion</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the EasyInfoView app and go to <strong>Admin → Account → Request deletion</strong>.</li>
      <li>Your account will be marked for deletion and a 7-day waiting period begins.</li>
      <li>During this time, you can still cancel the request from the same page if you change your mind.</li>
      <li>After the 7-day period ends, return to the same page and tap <strong>Confirm deletion</strong>.</li>
      <li>
        All your displays, items, and related data will then be permanently removed from our systems.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Final removal of your EasyInfoView account</h2>
    <p>
      Once your data deletion request is confirmed, your EasyInfoView user data is removed.  
      However, your Supabase authentication account (the login identity you used to sign in) must be
      deleted separately for security reasons.  
    </p>
    <p>
      As part of this process, your authentication profile (used for signing in with email and password)
      is also deleted from Supabase’s secure authentication service.  
      You do not need to perform any additional steps or contact Supabase directly — the deletion is
      completed automatically through EasyInfoView’s secure deletion function.
    </p>

    <h2>Need help?</h2>
    <p>

      registered email address. We will verify your identity and process the deletion manually.

    <h2>Data retention</h2>
    <p>
      After deletion, a minimal anonymized audit log may remain for security or legal compliance
      purposes. This record contains no personal data and cannot be used to identify you.
