  <h1>Privacy Policy for EasyInfoView</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>
    EasyInfoView is a display and content management application that allows users to create, edit, and view informational
    displays (“Displays”) and items (“Items”) across their own devices. This app is developed and maintained by an independent developer.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    EasyInfoView collects and stores only the minimum data necessary to provide the service. This includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>User authentication data (email address and password) handled securely by <strong>Supabase Auth</strong>.</li>
    <li>Display and Item content created by the user (such as names, prices, or text descriptions).</li>
    <li>Basic technical metadata such as timestamps and device identifiers used only for synchronization and security.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>No sensitive personal data (such as health, biometric, or financial information) is collected or processed.</p>

  <h2>3. Camera Usage</h2>
  <p>
    The app may request permission to use the device’s camera solely for scanning <strong>QR codes</strong>
    when the user chooses to transfer or enter an access key between devices.
    The camera feed is used only for reading QR codes — no images or videos are captured, stored, or transmitted.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>
    User data is securely stored in the <strong>Supabase</strong> backend, located within the European Union (or a region selected by Supabase).
    All connections between the app and server are encrypted using HTTPS.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Data Deletion</h2>
  <p>
    Users can request deletion of their accounts and all associated data from within the app at any time.
    Deleted accounts are permanently removed after a short grace period, except for minimal anonymized audit logs
    retained for legal or technical integrity purposes.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    EasyInfoView uses <strong>Supabase</strong> (https://supabase.com) for authentication, database, and storage services.
    These services operate in compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
  </p>

  <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
