  processing activities.
</p>

  Where processing is based on consent, you have the right to withdraw that
  consent at any time by contacting us at easyinfoview@gmail.com. Withdrawal of consent
  does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

  used and machine-readable formats, to enable you to transfer your data to
  another service provider.

  right to lodge a complaint with the Finnish Data Protection Ombudsman
  (<a href="https://tietosuoja.fi/en/home" target="_blank">https://tietosuoja.fi/en/home</a>)
  or your local supervisory authority.

  their applicable privacy rights.
